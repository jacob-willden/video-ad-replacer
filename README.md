# video-ad-replacer
Support content creators while replacing video advertisements with pleasant alternatives.

## Introduction
Many advertisements on video services like Youtube are inappropriate or center around highly sensitive topics. While one can normally click a link to "Stop seeing this ad" on Youtube, not all ads provide this option, including ads that can be demeaning or otherwise uncomfortable to the viewer. In response, many viewers have looked to ad-blockers, at the expense of being unable to financially support content creators or others. This extension is meant to act as a compromise, where video advertisements will play through, but the video and audio is blocked out.
